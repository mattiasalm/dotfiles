# dotfiles

My version of dotfiles with a CLI to manage installation process and updates.

Tested on macOS: Big Sur and Monterey.

Take and use at your own risk.

## Features

Very easy installation that brings a brand new installation of macOS up to full setup with just a few commands.

Uses:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - packages [Brewfile](./applications/Brewfile)
- [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) - packages [Brewfile](./applications/Caskfile)
- [Node.js + npm LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) - sync application settings
- [n](https://github.com/tj/n) - Node.js and npm version management

## Installation

1. Install the CLI with `curl`

### Mackup

When the setup is finished sign in to Dropbox and then run `mackup restore` to bring back app configurations.

Update SSH keys in all places needed, such as GitHub. [GitHub SSH key instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
